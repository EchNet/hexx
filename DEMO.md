	Ability to drag from palette and drop onto grid.
	Initial castle placed - requires numbering system for cells.

	Deployed
	Optional grid.  With on/off button.
	Use require.js to modularize.

NEXT:
	Background image on board.

	Proximity constraints.
		- Can (not) put something with (this value / any value) (on top of / next to) something with (this value / any value)

	Countable palette items.
	Double-click to clear hex (and return to sender) - but how to reconcile this with constraints?
