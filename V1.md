Entities:

Schema
	- Name (unique across site)
	- Password
	* Palette
		- Name (unique within schema)
		- Contents, an array of values
			* Value
	- Board Type (one per schema, for now)
		- Name (same as schema name, for now)
		- Background (fill or image)
		- Size
		- Initial contents
			* (Value, position)
	* Board
		- Name (optional)
		- Background (fill or image)
		- Size
		- Contents
			* (Value, position)
	A grid of cells, each of which can contain a value, or be empty.

A Value is just a dictionary of tags.

How is position identified?  A topic for some thought.

The rendering rules for a value are:
	- If value.url exists, use it as image url
	- If value.fill exists, use it as fill style
	- Else do some default rendering.
	But one day, we might be able to modify the rules.

A palette is the usual source of cell values, but there is no lasting association
between the source palette and the cell, or with the board as a whole.

A schema has a password.  Security is not important here, so we can use basic authentication.

There is no notion of a user.  Once you have delivered the password for a schema, it isencrypted into a cookie that persists for a few days.  Authentication is by password every time, so you can change the password out from under a user.
